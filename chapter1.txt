it was my first logging on version control. I hope I will be a doctor in the future, who will build new things with his programming skills and his religion knowledge.
I wish to rule the world to honor and elevate Allah's word InsyaAllah.
At least there three pilar those I should acquire, ISLAMIC KNOWLEDGE - it's the basic of all field -, TECHNOLOGY -it is the most needed in the world, all people rely on it. -, MEDICAL SCIENCE - the best knowledge after religion -.
